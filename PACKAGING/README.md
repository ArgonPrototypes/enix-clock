# Enix Clock Packaging
### The box the Enix ships in has an internal dimension of 6x6x3". To hold the clock and accessories, 1.5" laminated black polyethylene is CNC milled.
#CNC Milling Information
The foam inserts were machined using a Shapeoko 3 with a 6mm end mill made by Datron. The Datron product code is 00680560. A straight cut 6mm 2-flute from eBay was initially tested but with significantly worse results!
The Shapeoko's acceleration and maximum feedrates were increased through the MDI to speed up the cycle time as well.
