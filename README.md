# More info about each section: 
## Hardware:
The circuit board was designed in EAGLE CAD V9.2.2. I live in Canada, so most dimensions are in mm on this board. The Gerber files are in RS-274X and Excellon drill format. There are several external libraries used; Sparkfun, Adafruit, MacroFab, and a couple more for unique parts. There shouldn't be any problems with opening however.

## Software:
The majority of the software is written in VS Code with the PlatformIO extension. There are many C++ header files to organize sections of code that do some low level actions like settings menus, multiplexing, reading temperature etc. 



## 3D CAD:
The CNC machined case was designed in Solidworks.
